Medical organizations are dealing with an increasing volume of data. This data includes patient records, medical images, and treatment plans. Added to this is the need to improve data accessibility, collaboration between centres and the improvement of efficiency in medical care [1]. Cloud platforms provide solutions to these challenges. From the storage of this immense amount of data to tools to facilitate its sharing or accessibility.

One platform that stands out in this digital transformation is **SonicDICOM**.

## What is SonicDICOM?

{: .box-success}
SonicDICOM was created in 2003 by Fujidenolo Solutions Co. as a medical-use system based on JPEG images. The data center was not established until 2008, with the aim of being able to offer a cloud service to its customers.

SonicDICOM is a web-based medical imaging platform for storage, visualization and sharing, offering cloud environments [2]. It allows you to manage and share DICOM format diagnostic images (such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, etc) in order to improve DICOM flows in hospitals [3].
